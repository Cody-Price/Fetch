# Welcome to Fetch!

Fetch is a dog adoption app made with React.JS as an assignment at the Turing School of Software and design.
This project was a collaboration between Theo Bean (@b3an5), Kaylee Novak (@kayleenovak), and Cody Price (@cody-price).
The App gives users a list of adoptable dogs and gives them a way to filter out dogs in order to find the perfect pet as well as putting them into contact with the shelter they are currently located.
