# Fetch

Fetch is a dog adoption app made to give users a list of adoptable dogs as well as a way to filter/search various traits in order to find the perfect pet and put them in contact with the corresponding shelter that the pet is currently located.

This project was the first React project that me and my team have ever written and was assigned as a team project to be completed over a period of 7 days. Part of the project was to design our own non-relational database and build an asynchronous single page application of our choosing.
